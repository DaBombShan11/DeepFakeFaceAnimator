            Deepfakes represent a new frontier in synthetic media, where a person's likeness is convincingly replaced with that of another using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly deep learning. This technology enables the creation of highly realistic audio and video manipulations, making it increasingly difficult to discern authentic content from fabricated versions. While deepfakes have garnered significant attention for their potential misuse—such as spreading misinformation, committing identity theft, and engaging in defamation—they also hold legitimate applications in areas like entertainment and training simulations.

	The tutorials in this simulator will provide a comprehensive overview of the various methods used to detect deepfakes in images and videos. Techniques such as pixel analysis, metadata inspection, and pattern recognition will be explored in detail. Additionally, we will examine the intersection of deepfakes and phishing, highlighting how attackers may exploit deepfake technology to enhance their scams. Real-world examples of common phishing tactics will also be included, equipping users with the knowledge needed to recognize and defend against these threats.
